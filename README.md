# Production Scheduling Desktop App

Production Scheduling Desktop App leverages Google Sheets as a database to streamline production scheduling with cross-platform support, interactive Gantt charts, and role-based access control.

## Overview
This app streamlines production scheduling by managing all schedule information in one Google Sheet and displaying progress with interactive Gantt charts.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** No additional database needed.
- **Scheduling & Gantt Charts:** Auto generates visual timelines.
- **Secure Authentication:** Uses a secure JSON key from Google Cloud.
- **User Role Management:** Customizes view and access based on roles.
- **Flexibility:** Minimal UI with optional extensions.


## Installation & Setup

1. Download the Application 

    - This application is designed for company-specific use, with builds available on their hardware. However, the source code is fully open for anyone to use and modify.
    - To get started, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and build the app following the instructions below.
    - To customize the app for your specific needs:
        - Edit src/data/tabs.tsx to adjust the tabs configuration to match your Google Sheet columns.
        - Modify src/data/defaults.tsx to align with your data. These changes will update how initial Google Sheets are generated and structured in the app.

2. Obtain Google Sheets Credentials

    - Follow the instructions below in Managing Your Google Sheets Credentials to get a .json file from Google Cloud.
    - Drag and drop that file into the app or paste its contents into the appropriate screen.

3. Enter Spreadsheet ID

    - Inside the app, once credentials are loaded, provide the ID of the Google Spreadsheet you want to use.
    - Ensure that the service account email address (found in your .json file) has permission to edit the Google Sheet.

4. Start Scheduling

    - The app will load your Sheet data, show you a table of jobs, and generate Gantt charts.

Thatâ€™s it. You can now view and manage your production schedule.
